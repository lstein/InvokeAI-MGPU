    """
    Context manager object that mediates transfer from RAM<->VRAM.

    This is a context manager object that has two distinct APIs:

    1. Older API (deprecated):
    Use the LoadedModel object directly as a context manager.
    It will move the model into VRAM (on CUDA devices), and
    return the model in a form suitable for passing to torch.
    Example:
    ```
    loaded_model_= loader.get_model_by_key('f13dd932', SubModelType('vae'))
    with loaded_model as vae:
      image = vae.decode(latents)[0]
    ```

    2. Newer API (recommended):
    Call the LoadedModel's `model_on_device()` method in a
    context. It returns a tuple consisting of a copy of
    the model's state dict in CPU RAM followed by a copy
    of the model in VRAM. The state dict is provided to allow
    LoRAs and other model patchers to return the model to
    its unpatched state without expensive copy and restore
    operations.

    Example:
    ```
    loaded_model_= loader.get_model_by_key('f13dd932', SubModelType('vae'))
    with loaded_model.model_on_device() as (state_dict, vae):
        image = vae.decode(latents)[0]
    ```

    The state_dict should be treated as a read-only object and
    never modified. Also be aware that some loadable models do
    not have a state_dict, in which case this value will be None.

# Some "intermediary" subclasses in the ModelLoaderBase class hierarchy define methods that their subclasses don't

# For example, GenericDiffusersLoader defines `get_hf_load_class()`, and StableDiffusionDiffusersModel attempts to
# call it. However, the method is not defined in the ABC, so it is not guaranteed to be implemented.
